# Barber-db-seed-generator
Repository with seed data file generator for sql exercise

Simple and small app to generate visits for five different Barber Studios each of them having few employes.
App chooses random studio, random employee and random date and hour of visit as well as a random treatment. 
Time frame and working hours are set in app itself.
App checks if employee chosen is avaialable at chosen time if not it begins the process another time. 
That allowed to generate thousands of visits to perform different SELECT querries during SQL exercises instead of defining visits manually which was the scope of exercise.
